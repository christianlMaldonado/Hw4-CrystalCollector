//the player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. 19 - 120

// When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount 
// of points to the player's total score. 1 - 12

// The player wins if their total score matches the random number 
// from the beginning of the game.

// The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

// The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

// When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number.
//  Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, 
//  the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
